# Wiki4HE
# Wiki4HE is a homework team project with a data mining approach to test the dataset has a quality or no

The dataset can be accessed in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wiki4HE
My main reference related to this assignment from this url: https://github.com/gustavomdomingues/Wiki4HE/blob/master/GustavoDomingues_Desafio_DTI.ipynb

For this homework, the main task is to know the dataset has a good quality or no. There's a characteristic feature of a low-quality dataset such as: 
  - to much noise,
  - missing values,
  - duplication data,
  - wrong data, 
  - fake data.
 
 Especially for the missing values there is a solution: eliminate the object data, estimated the missing values, ignore the missing values while analyzing 
 the data, and replacing the values using probability values.
